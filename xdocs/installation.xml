                To build the just about anything within the NeuClear framework you first need to install <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/maven/">Maven</a>.
                Follow their installation instructions and you should be ok. I haven't tried this under windows yet, but I'm guessing
                it should work fine.

                Unpack the source and binary distributions. Familiarise yourself a bit with maven. It's a bit different than ant, but
                very easy to learn. To see the options available go to the type:
            </p>
            <source>~/projects/neuclear-ledger> maven -g</source>
            <p>
                Of these the most important one is to simply type:
            </p>
            <source>~/projects/neuclear-ledger> maven jar</source>
            <p>
                This should build everything and create a neuclear-ledger-0.X.jar file in <tt>target/</tt>.
