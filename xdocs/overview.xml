                To understand it you need a basic understanding of ledgers. A ledger consists of a list of transactions.
                Each transaction has a credit and a debit book (or account) as well as an amount. This means each transaction affects
                one account negatively and one account positively.
                To view the balance of a book you simply add up all the credit amounts and deduct all the debit amounts.

        <section name="API Overview">
            <p>
                The API currently consists of 3 main classes:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="apidocs/org/neuclear/ledger/Ledger.html">Ledger</a></li>
                    <li><a href="apidocs/org/neuclear/ledger/Book.html">Book</a></li>
                    <li><a href="apidocs/org/neuclear/ledger/Transaction.html">Transaction</a></li>
                </ul>
                Implementing classes extend the abstract class Ledger. Book and Transaction are final as are several items in the
                Ledger class.
